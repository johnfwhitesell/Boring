This presentation looks at what would be the most effective way to divert car traffic 
into the proposed Loop technology of underground passenger vehicles.  This primary challenge
is to find what are the conditions under which consumers will change behaviors.  Because
there is no existing data on loop, the differences between metro travellers and car travellers
were studied.  This study was done with the early data release from the
American Community Survey 2012-2017 "Day Trip" files released by the Federal Highway Administration

The study was restricted to the DC metropolitan area because mass transit systems are so dissimilar 
across the US and DC is one of the early proposed sites for the loop.
A random forest model was used to find which factors were most important to people's travel choices.
An estimate of proximity to subway stations was found to be the single most powerful predictor.  Additionally
whether or not a person was commuting to work was extremely important.  Travellers are more
likely to take the metro when going to or from work to a surprising degree.  Based on these two factors
the largest immediate impact would be made available by connecting parts of the city which are not
near metro stations to existing metro stations.  Consumers that are always within 15 minutes of the metro
system are likely to use it during peak congestion times.  Thus the maximum returns would be obtained by
connecting the unconnected areas.  Getting additional cars off the road would require changing the
travel paradigm people are currently using.  Hopefully the upcoming release of census tract level data
will shed insight on what conditions will make people stop using personal vehicles in circumstances
beyond the work commute.
